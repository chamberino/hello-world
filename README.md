# hello-world

Howdy,

I'm an amateur coder interested in Front-End Web Development, particularly JavaScript. After graduating from Berklee College of Music I worked as an assistant to the film composer David Kitay. My interest in programming began while managing Kitay's social media and creating his website. I'm here on GitHub to keep my projects organized while I practice my coding chops. I'm also a huge improv nerd!
